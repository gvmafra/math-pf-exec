genStageTwelve() works as expected, but there is one key problem:

Let's say that a challenge with 9 cells is generated, 
with 4 of them being toggled. The canvas below is generated, but it only contains 3 cells, 
therefore it is impossible to toggle the specified number of toggles to move through the level.

Let's also say that, in a level in which a challenge has 6 cells, 
out of which 3 are selected (which represents 1/2), 
it should not be possible for the canvas below to have 3 cells, 
because there would be no way to toggle it into equivalence.

How can we make sure that these errors don't happen?

-------------------------//-----------------------------
ANSWER:

The solution is to validate and make sure that the number of cells
 in the canvas is always equal or greater than the maximum number of 
 toggles needed for any challenge. To validate this, you can add a check for this in the 
 `initializeLevels` function or directly in the loop that generates challenges.
 Here is an example of how you can do it with a while loop:

```typescript
stages.forEach((stage) => {
  let generatedLevels;
  
  do {
    generatedLevels = initializeLevels(
      genRandomChallengeCanvases({
        numCellsFilter: stage.numCellsFilter,
        difficultyFilter: difficultyFilter,
        toggleRatio: .5,
        numberofChallenges: stage.numberOfLevels,
      }),
      concatArrays<GameCanvas>([
        initializeLevelChallenges(
          getRandomOptions(
            filterChallenges({
              numCellsFilter: stage.numCellsFilter,
              difficultyFilter: difficultyFilter,
            }).map((challengeId) => ({
              challengeId,
            })),
            stage.numberOfLevels
          )
        )
      ])
    );

    // Make sure challenge numToggles is less than or equal to canvasSize
    const isValid = generatedLevels.every((level) => {
      const challengeSize = level.challenge.numToggles;
      const canvasSize = level.canvas.cells.length;
      
      return challengeSize <= canvasSize;
    });
    
  } while (!isValid);
  
  levels = [...levels, ...generatedLevels];
});
```
This ensures that for each level in `generatedLevels`, 
the `canvas.cells.length` is always at least as large as `level.challenge.numToggles`. 
If this is not the case the levels are regenerated. 
This should prevent impossible puzzle scenarios from being generated.

PROMPT:

Does this take into account a puzzle scenario in which the challenge has 2 cells, 
with 1 toggled, representing 1/2, and the canvas below has 8 cells, 
which could create an equivalence of 4/8 = 1/2?

-------------------------//-----------------------------
ANSWER:

Yes, the code snippet I've provided takes into account the actual number of toggles, 
not the proportion of toggles to total cells. 
However, if you would like to prevent equivalence by ratio and focus on the actual count of toggles, 
you need to communicate that aspect clearly inside your challenge and game instruction.

But, if you'd like to tackle this in the way you've said, 
considering the proportion of toggles rather than the total count, 
you'll need to add an additional check. 

This check would compare the toggle ratio of the challenge to the canvas 
and ensure that they are not equivalent unless the number of cells is also equivalent.

Modifying the example provided above:

```typescript
// Make sure challenge numToggles is not equivalent to canvasSize
const isValid = generatedLevels.every((level) => {
  const challengeToggleRatio = level.challenge.numToggles / level.challenge.totalCells;
  const canvasToggleRatio = level.canvas.cells.filter(cell => cell).length / level.canvas.cells.length;

  const isEquivalentRatio = challengeToggleRatio === canvasToggleRatio;
  const isSameTotalCells = level.challenge.totalCells === level.canvas.cells.length;

  // return true if ratio is not equivalent OR if ratio is equivalent and total cells is also the same
  return !isEquivalentRatio || (isEquivalentRatio && isSameTotalCells);
});
```

In this version, `isValid` will only be true if 
the toggle ratios are not equivalent OR if the toggle ratios and total number of cells are both equivalent. 
If the ratios are equivalent but the total number of cells are not the same, 
`isValid` will be false and the loop will generate new levels. 

This should prevent the scenario you mentioned from happening.
